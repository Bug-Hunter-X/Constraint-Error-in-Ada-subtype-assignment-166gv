This example demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: assigning a value outside the range of a subtype.  The `Positive` subtype is defined to only accept values greater than 0.  Assigning 0 to the variable `X` violates this constraint, resulting in a `Constraint_Error` exception.  The solution involves ensuring that values assigned to the variable are always within the allowed range of the subtype.
